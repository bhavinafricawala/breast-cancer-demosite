        Donate your new or gently used clothing, shoes, and small household
        items to United Breast Cancer Research Foundation to help fight breast
        cancer. Your donations are given to local thrift stores, and the
        proceeds are used to support breast cancer research.

      <div class="item item4 ">
        When your donation is picked up or dropped off at one of our community
        donation centers you will receive a donation receipt. Any single item
        that's valued over $500 must be accompanied by a certified appraisal to
        be claimed on your tax return. (For more information on valuing and
        claiming donations, please visit irs.gov. United Breast Cancer Research
        Foundation does not offer any appraisal services.
